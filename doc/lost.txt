INTRODUCTION                                    *lost*

Lost provides a single command, |lost-:Lost|, to help you orient yourself in
large sections of code.

Context                                         *lost-context*

Lost borrows the concept of the C function from `diff(1)`, which `git(1)` uses
to give context by default.  I am astounded, after using `git(1)` as long as I
have, how often the "C function" works for almost every single bit of code
I've ever written.  I hope it works just as well for you!
